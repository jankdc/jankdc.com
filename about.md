Hello there! My name is Jan, and I am currently an undergraduate student studying Computer Science. I love programming languages and writing tools that makes anyone and their dog be productive! I will use this website to write down some of my journey as a developer. Recently, I have been implementing a brand new language called 'Occam'. I will be posting regularly to talk about its progress.

## Setup

Some fun facts about the setup of this website include:

* Built for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
* Developed on GitHub and hosted on [Linode](https://linode.com)
* Coded with [Sublime Text 3](http://sublimetext.com), an amazing code editor

Thanks for reading!
